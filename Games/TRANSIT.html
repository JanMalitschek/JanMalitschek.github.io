                TRANSIT (WIP)
                <p class="descriptionText">
                    A game about finding your way home through a crowded subway network while being persued by an anonymous assassin,
                    with a heavy focus on strategic gameplay.
                    This is my current an probably most sophisticated project yet as there have to be so many different choices that
                    the player can make in order to get home safely.
                </p>

                <p class="descriptionText">
                    For this project, while still doing all the programming and most of the art work, I'm getting a lot of help with writing
                    and planning from Andrew Snowman and with 3D assets from Arthur Erlich. The game will feature a lot of randomly decorated
                    environments and thus many different assets and textures are necessary.
                </p>

                <p class="descriptionText">
                    The game will also feature many different people including simple civilians, workers, merchants but also muggers and the
                    assassin of course all with different and unique AI and behavior to them.
