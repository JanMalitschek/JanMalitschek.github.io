                The Silent House
                <p class="descriptionText">
                    A game about a drug investigator who get's dragged into something much worse than he anticipated.<br>
                    This game started as a fun little project during the winter holidays of 2016. At some point I decided<br>
                    to turn it into a finished game and released a demo version which got pretty popular.<br>
                    The game can be found <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/TheSilentHouse/254383">here</a>

                    In the process of making this game I was able to explore many new techniques in level design and programming.<br>
                    In retrospective it does have many flaws but it still taught me a lot of valuable lessons in many fields of<br>
                    gamedesign and lead me to meeting a bunch of awesome people who I still work with today.

                    It is important to mention that this was a complete solo project up until the release of the Anniversary Update,
                    where I got help with ideas and writing the story.
