                    Trials of Argolis is a First-Person meele combat Bossrush set in Ancient Greece mixed with some fantasy elements.</br>
                    Inspired by popular combat games like Dark Souls and Sekiro it combines First-Person movement</br>
                    with fast paced melee combat requiring quick reflexes and well timed reactions.</br>
                    The game can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1453460/Trials_of_Argolis/">here</a>

                    Trials of Argolis is by far my most ambitious project to date. It started as a procedural open world boss rush in a PSX style
                    went through multiple prototyping stages including one complete rewrite from scratch until I finally settled on the game it has become now.<br>
                    The final game was created in about 6 months from start to finish including all the required assets such as textures(which were handpainted),
                    models, animation, SFX and OST.<br>
                    It has definitely taught me the most in terms of character animations since almost every single boss(there are 15 of them) has a unique moveset.

                    It is important to mention that this was a complete solo project apart from the help I with QA Testing and fixing a performance issue.
