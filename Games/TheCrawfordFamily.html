                The CrawfordFamily
                <p class="descriptionText">
                    A game about an unnamed protagonist who wakes up inside a rural residence and soon finds himself persued by
                    its inhabitants.<br>
                    This game was created for The Haunted PS1 GameJam, a GameJam about creating retro looking horrorgames, in only
                    one month.<br>
                    The game can be found <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/The_Crawford_Family/376599">here</a>

                    This was my first ever game using a third person player controller which opened up a whole new set of challenges
                    that I was very happy to tackle.
                    Heavily inspired by Resident Evil 7, it features three unique bossfights that happen in rather quick succession.
                    I focussed a lot on creating a tense atmosphere by mostly using ambience sound and rarely any soundtrack.

                    The textures in this game were created from photos that I took and most of the ambience was recorded by me as well.
